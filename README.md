# Task 5: Decision Trees and Random Forests

## Objective
Build tree-based models for classifying the presence of heart disease using the Heart Disease Dataset.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, cross_val_score)

## Key Steps
1. Load and inspect the dataset (`heart.csv`).
2. Train a Decision Tree Classifier and visualize it.
3. Control tree depth to reduce overfitting.
4. Train a Random Forest Classifier and compare accuracy.
5. Analyze feature importances.
6. Evaluate both models using cross-validation.

## Dataset
- File: `heart.csv`
- Source: UCI Heart Disease dataset (processed)
- Target variable: `target` (1 = disease, 0 = no disease)

## Deliverables
- `task_5_decision_tree_random_forest.ipynb`
- Visualizations of decision tree and feature importances
- Accuracy and cross-validation comparison
